## Proxies For All

### Documentation -
so for this "mission" of sorts im going to be creating copious [hehehe, get it?] amounts of proxies to be spread throughout the week, once the week ends, theyll all be down, and gone.
might come back and do another week at the end of the year
Doing this all by hand is gonna drive me insane but its alright i guess.

Making of proxies is being done now!
current amount : 0
goal : 30
(this is a lot for one school district to have floating around)

Should be getting help to make sure none of them get blocked before the release date!
